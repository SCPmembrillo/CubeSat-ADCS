# CubeSat Attitude Determination Control System (Currently Working on it!)
## Progress so far
This is my most recent proyect focused on developing the attitude determination and control system for a 3U CubeSat. The system utilizes three orthogonally mounted reaction wheels to control the satellite's orientation.

The project is pretty big, so I started with simulations:
- [x] Studied fundamental physics, including Euler's equations and reference frames.
- [x] Performed preliminary simulations to validate the models.
- [ ] Developed initial control system concepts.
- [ ] Conducted simulations including the control systems

The simulations are done in Python, you can check them out [here](#).
